## Game Specfic Info

> [!NOTE]
 **Honkai Impact**
>
> HI3 handles file storage really weird, I simply cannot organize and or make it easier for you than I've already done. Images have been placed but will not always be accurate.
>
> Many thanks to Yuki :D

> [!NOTE]
**Wuthering Waves**
>
> These are ripped using FModel QA build.
>
> The original uemodel files are uploaded as well as a converted FBX model when possible.
>
> All models that have morphs will have morphs in both formats (.uemodel and .fbx).
>
> If you want to open the uemodel's on your own, you can load them using the [Blender plugin](https://github.com/halfuwu/UEFormat).
>
> I personally do not know all the character names, but if you do, feel free to update their names and make a pull request.
>
> Many thanks to Mana :D
